# Methods
snow ball sampling of active duty and veteran couples. Must have one deployment? Or include couples with no deployment to examine the difference in stressors between deploy and no deploy couples?
## Participants
- Austin's relatives?
- Tabling at the VA
- Couples of all branches, 2 year since last deployment, combat not required
## Operational Definitions
It is important to establish what we define as a family. The literature varies on what is considered a family. For the purposes of this study a family will be broadly defined as a composition of two or more persons who are brought together over time by mutual consent who, together, assume responsibilities for familial functions (Benzies and Mychasiuk, 2009; Vanier Institute of the Family 2004). For the purposes of our study a couple must be cohabitating but not necessarily married. 
When determining the appropriate period of time to consider "post-deployment" I refer to the Yellow Ribbon Reintegration Program, which describes post-deployment is the first 180 days after the service member returns to their home station. 
## Possible Interview Questions
A question that remains unanswered is how does the process of reintegration mirror the process of separation? Are there similar fears and difficulties experienced when a service member cones back from deployment?
