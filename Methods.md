**write those section in the future tense and use words like “approximately” “expected” and the like to indicate that these aspects of research are currently unknown.**
### Methodology
The qualitative approach used in this study will be interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA). IPA attempts to explore one's personal experience with the world around them and is concerned with the individuals perception of an event (Smith, 2015). In the case of this study we are attempting to understand the military couples experience as they re-integrate into life at home after a deployment. The researchers are not attempting to make an objective statement regarding re-integration itself but rather we are trying to bring light to the unique subjective experience of the military couple. An acknowledgment that is made when utilizing IPA methodology is that there are two layers of interpretation involved in any sort of data gathering. There is the participant attempting to the understand their world and there is the researcher attempting to understand the participant who is attempting to understand their world. This dual layer of abstraction is called a *double hermeneutic* It is the reason a researcher chooses to focus their inquiry on the perception of the participant rather than trying to gain an objective understanding of the world. 
Lastly, IPA is an idiographic approach to research as opposed to a nomothetic approach (Smith, 2015). That is to say, IPA is more interested in the detailed examination of a particular case. In this study, that detailed examination is focused on one specific part of the overall deployment cycle of which a military couple is navigating. We are interested in what is happening for the military couple at the point in time when the service member has returned home and is attempting to navigate family life and re-connect with their civilian partner. 
### Social Location and Researcher Bias
As the researcher conducting the participant interviews and performing the coding of transcripts, it is important to be aware of my entry point into the research as well as making the reader aware of possible biases I may have. I have taken steps to become aware of and minimize the influence that my biases may have on the research however, it is impossible to completely sever oneself from their biases**CITATIN**. At the time of data collection and interpretation the primary student researcher will have joined the Air Force and upon completion of their doctorate degree will be working as a clinical psychologist in an active duty capacity. Given my affiliation with the Air Force it is possible to want to over-analyze or otherwise focus too closely on the positive aspects that result from a military life. ** 「At the same time…mention some possible positives that might occur because of your closeness to the research. Next – what steps will you take to minimize these biases.」** Their is currently minimal research on the positive aspects of being a member of the military community which is why this paper chooses to focus, in part, on those positive factors. 
### Participants and Recruitment
**page 78 of RNB has additions to this section derived from Ding and LRC edits.**
**Marek and D'Aniello had N=675 and Laresen had N=18. Can reference these two studies as inspiration and talk about what is realistic for self**
Requirements of participants are to be either a) a partnered service member (SM) of any military branch who has been deployed within the last two years or b) a partner of a SM who was deployed within the last two years. Participants will be asked if they and their partner would like to be a part of an additional interview component. The purpose of the interview is to gather information that is only possible from in-person interviews.
**give details of the participants to help conceptualize results**
Sampling methods will include snowball sampling methods as well as reaching out to local community organizations involved in supporting military families. After making contact with initial military couples, we hope to utilize "friends of friends" and "word of mouth" to gather a sufficient number of participants. **「give number of participants you hope to get in survey and number for interviews as well.」**
*Proposal Specifics*
* how many people do I aim to include
* Close contacts
* National Guard contacts
* local community events
	### Operational Definitions
It is important to establish what we define as a family. Although the definitions in the literature vary for the purposes of this study a family will be defined as a composition of two or more persons who are brought together over time by mutual consent who, together, assume responsibilities for familial functions (Benzies and Mychasiuk, 2009; Vanier Institute of the Family 2004). For the purposes of our study a couple must be cohabitating but not necessarily married. 
Lastly, When determining the appropriate period of time to consider "post-deployment" I will refer to the Yellow Ribbon Reintegration Program, which describes post-deployment is the first 180 days after the service member returns to their home station.
### Procedure
Data collection will be done via a qualitative survey sent out to participants gathered from sources stated above. For those participants who are willing, a qualitative interview will be conducted to gather additional information.
* talks about survey structure and format
* include question samples
* mention bracketing again just because
**「Need a bit more: IRB approval, email recruitment (or online posting?), survey link, informed consent, private Qualtrics survey account accessible only to you and us and RA, order questions will be presented in, how participant will exit survey, any incentives, any resources offered during data collection (like to reintegration assistance).  Basically, walk us through everything your participant would encounter as they take your survey.  Also, may be good idea to mention survey is anonymous unless anyone consents to provide contact info for follow up interview, in which case it becomes confidential.  Should make sure no one but you can access that contact info (so would remove that from any electronic database you share with an RA for coding purposes).」**
### Survey Questions
**「And are all of these survey questions or are some for the survey and some for any follow up interview you may be able to do?  Also, if you’re going to give orienting instructions, say what those will be. 」**
A question that remains unanswered is how does the process of reintegration mirror the process of separation? Are there similar fears and difficulties experienced when a service member cones back from deployment?
Should I have a question to ask participants if they asked their partner to complete the study. If yes, what was their response and if no, why not?
**Guiding Question**: what is the lived experience of the military couple dyad navigating post-deployment life?
**Possible Questions**
* How long have you been in a relationship together?
* Are you married? If so, for how long?
* Branch of Service?
* SM: Years in service
* age, gender, rank
* Date range of most recent deployment
* SM: How many times have you deployed during your career?
* SM: Did you experience any combat during your latest deployment?
* Do you have children? 
Pulling from Larsen et al (2015) these questions are broken up into three domains: individual level processes, family beliefs/practices, and sociocultrual processes.
*lots of comments in LRC edits about questions*
**Individual Level**
* What were your main sources of support during the post-deployment phase?
* if had multiple deployments, Were there any patterns in the coming home process that you noticed across your multiple deployments?
* Were there any stressors that were salient for you and your partner when you (they) came home from deployment (i.e. finances, chores, sexual frustration, loneliness etc.?)
* What has been the hardest part of your re-adjusting to life at home after your (partner's) most recent deployment?
* What was the best part of your re-adjusting to life at home after your (partner's) most recent deployment?
  - Alternative to 2 above: what have been the most salient experiences of your being back at home after deployment?
* what kind of actions did you and your family take in preparation for the service member returning from deployment?
**Family Beliefs/Practices**
* Did your family receive any formal training (such as STRONG BONDS) on how to work through post-deployment difficulties?
* What do you feel you've learned about your relationship as a result of your latest deployment?
* How does military culture fit with your family's culture?
* What was communication like for you and your partner when (you) they got back from deployment?

**Sociocultural Processes**
* Did social support from friends or family play a role in the coming home process?* * {If multiple deployments} Were there any patterns in the coming home process that were consistent across multiple deployments? 
  - Did the coming home process change over the multiple deployments?
