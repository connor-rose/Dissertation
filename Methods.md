**write those section in the future tense and use words like “approximately” “expected” and the like to indicate that these aspects of research are currently unknown.**
### Methodology
The qualitative approach used in this study will be interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA). IPA attempts to explore one's personal experience with the world around them and is concerned with the individuals perception of an event (Smith, 2015). In the case of this study we are attempting to understand the military couples experience as they re-integrate into life at home after a deployment. The researchers are not attempting to make an objective statement regarding re-integration itself but rather we are trying to bring light to the unique subjective experience of the military couple. An acknowledgment that is made when utilizing IPA methodology is that there are two layers of interpretation involved in any sort of data gathering. There is the participant attempting to the understand their world and there is the researcher attempting to understand the participant who is attempting to understand their world. This dual layer of abstraction is called a *double hermeneutic* It is the reason a researcher chooses to focus their inquiry on the perception of the participant rather than trying to gain an objective understanding of the world. 
Lastly, IPA is an idiographic approach to research as opposed to a nomothetic approach (Smith, 2015). That is to say, IPA is more interested in the detailed examination of a particular case. In this study, that detailed examination is focused on one specific part of the overall deployment cycle of which a military couple is navigating. We are interested in what is happening for the military couple at the point in time when the service member has returned home and is attempting to navigate family life and re-connect with their civilian partner. 
### Social Location and Researcher Bias
As the researcher conducting the participant interviews and performing the coding of transcripts, it is important to be aware of my entry point into the research as well as making the reader aware of possible biases I may have. I have taken steps to become aware of and minimize the influence that my biases may have on the research however, it is impossible to completely sever oneself from their biases**CITATIN**. At the time of data collection and interpretation the primary student researcher will have joined the Air Force and upon completion of their doctorate degree will be working as a clinical psychologist in an active duty capacity. Given my affiliation with the Air Force it is possible to want to over-analyze or otherwise focus too closely on the positive aspects that result from a military life. ** 「At the same time…mention some possible positives that might occur because of your closeness to the research. Next – what steps will you take to minimize these biases.」** Their is currently minimal research on the positive aspects of being a member of the military community which is why this paper chooses to focus, in part, on those positive factors. 
### Participants and Recruitment
**page 78 of RNB has additions to this section derived from Ding and LRC edits.**
**Marek and D'Aniello had N=675 and Laresen had N=18. Can reference these two studies as inspiration and talk about what is realistic for self**
Requirements of participants are to be either a) a partnered service member (SM) of any military branch who has been deployed within the last two years or b) a partner of a SM who was deployed within the last two years. Participants will be asked if they and their partner would like to be a part of an additional interview component. The purpose of the interview is to gather information that is only possible from in-person interviews.
**give details of the participants to help conceptualize results**
Sampling methods will include snowball sampling methods as well as reaching out to local community organizations involved in supporting military families. After making contact with initial military couples, we hope to utilize "friends of friends" and "word of mouth" to gather a sufficient number of participants. **「give number of participants you hope to get in survey and number for interviews as well.」**
*Proposal Specifics*
* how many people do I aim to include
* Close contacts
* National Guard contacts
* local community events
	### Operational Definitions
It is important to establish what we define as a family. Although the definitions in the literature vary for the purposes of this study a family will be defined as a composition of two or more persons who are brought together over time by mutual consent who, together, assume responsibilities for familial functions (Benzies and Mychasiuk, 2009; Vanier Institute of the Family 2004). For the purposes of our study a couple must be cohabitating but not necessarily married. 
Lastly, When determining the appropriate period of time to consider "post-deployment" I will refer to the Yellow Ribbon Reintegration Program, which describes post-deployment is the first 180 days after the service member returns to their home station.
### Procedure
**「Need a bit more: IRB approval, email recruitment (or online posting?), survey link, informed consent, private Qualtrics survey account accessible only to you and us and RA, order questions will be presented in, how participant will exit survey, any incentives, any resources offered during data collection (like to reintegration assistance).  Basically, walk us through everything your participant would encounter as they take your survey.  Also, may be good idea to mention survey is anonymous unless anyone consents to provide contact info for follow up interview, in which case it becomes confidential.  Should make sure no one but you can access that contact info (so would remove that from any electronic database you share with an RA for coding purposes).」**
In this study, the emphasis is on understanding the lived experience of a military couple during the post-deployment phase of deployment. We will be utilizing a qualitative survey to gather this information. A qualitative survey is the most appropriate method for data collection because it allows us to ask opne-ended questions while also reaching a wide sample size when compared to doing only in-person interviews. Recruitment will be done via online postings and listserv postings for organizations relevant to the topic of interest as well as through utilization of current military community contacts of the research team. The online sources include but are note limited to The APA Division 19 listserv, milspouse.com (a support website for military spouses)**THNK UV OTHR SOURSES**. The recruitment flyer will have a brief statement regarding the purpose of the survey, inculsion critertia for participants, and a statement regarding the fact that this study is not connected with the Department of Defense or any other defense agency and that it is completely voluntary if individuals choose to participate. A detailed informed consent will be included at the beginning of the survey prior to any data collection.
The survey will be run on a private Qualtrics survey account acessible only by myself, the two faculty supervisors, and a research assistant. The survey is to include an introduction to the survey structure, and the informed consent. The survey will include three open-ended questions each covering the broad theme of information we intend to gather. The three broad themes are: a) **see RNB for this part**. The three questions will be presented to each participant randomly to avoid order effects on responses. At the end of the survey participants will be offered an opportunity to conduct an additional skype interview to collect more specific information related to domains established by Larsen et al (2015): individual level processes, family beliefs/practices, and sociocultrual processes. After that participants will be debriefed, offered resources for military couples support services and/or reintegration servies, and given a thank you for their participation and service. This survey is an anonymous survey unless participants agree to a skype interview and provide contact informatoin in which case the survey information will become confidential. Contact information will be removed from survey data and stored separately thus only accessible by the primary researcher. This contact information will be stored in a encrypted Box online storage account. After data collection the survey responses will be coded by myself and possibly an additional research assistant. The research assitant would be a graduate student from Pacific University. The researcher, familiar with qualitative methods, will analyze the data. 
### Survey Questions
**「And are all of these survey questions or are some for the survey and some for any follow up interview you may be able to do?  Also, if you’re going to give orienting instructions, say what those will be. 」**
A question that remains unanswered is how does the process of reintegration mirror the process of separation? Are there similar fears and difficulties experienced when a service member cones back from deployment?
Should I have a question to ask participants if they asked their partner to complete the study. If yes, what was their response and if no, why not?
**Guiding Question**: what is the lived experience of the military couple dyad navigating post-deployment life?
**Possible Questions**
* How long have you been in a relationship together?
* Are you married? If so, for how long?
* Branch of Service?
* SM: Years in service
* age, gender, rank
* Date range of most recent deployment
* SM: How many times have you deployed during your career?
* SM: Did you experience any combat during your latest deployment?
* Do you have children? 
Pulling from Larsen et al (2015) these questions are broken up into three domains: individual level processes, family beliefs/practices, and sociocultrual processes.
*lots of comments in LRC edits about questions*
**Individual Level**
* What were your main sources of support during the post-deployment phase?
* if had multiple deployments, Were there any patterns in the coming home process that you noticed across your multiple deployments?
* Were there any stressors that were salient for you and your partner when you (they) came home from deployment (i.e. finances, chores, sexual frustration, loneliness etc.?)
* What has been the hardest part of your re-adjusting to life at home after your (partner's) most recent deployment?
* What was the best part of your re-adjusting to life at home after your (partner's) most recent deployment?
  - Alternative to 2 above: what have been the most salient experiences of your being back at home after deployment?
* what kind of actions did you and your family take in preparation for the service member returning from deployment?
**Family Beliefs/Practices**
* Did your family receive any formal training (such as STRONG BONDS) on how to work through post-deployment difficulties?
* What do you feel you've learned about your relationship as a result of your latest deployment?
* How does military culture fit with your family's culture?
* What was communication like for you and your partner when (you) they got back from deployment?

**Sociocultural Processes**
* Did social support from friends or family play a role in the coming home process?* * {If multiple deployments} Were there any patterns in the coming home process that were consistent across multiple deployments? 
  - Did the coming home process change over the multiple deployments?
