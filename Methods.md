# Methods

* should i go full qualitative? Finding a differentiation between info to ask in quant v info to ask for in qual is getting grey. Only way I could think of doing mixed methods is if I include a marital satisfaction survey for quant but then that feels like I'm just making the project uneccessarily complicated. So my thinking is going full qual and doing interviews or qual survey. I'm realizign that getting both members of a dyad to sit down for an inteview may be really tricky. I could do the Mark and D'aniello article method which is collect data from non-linked service mems and civ partners. Their article specifically said that reworking their methodology with linked couples would be better though. 

snow ball sampling of active duty and veteran couples. Must have one deployment? Or include couples with no deployment to examine the difference in stressors between deploy and no deploy couples?

### Participants and Recruitment

* Austin's relatives?
* Tabling at the VA
* Couples of all branches, 2 year since last deployment, combat not required
* National Guard contacts of Alexa Landsman
* local community event

### Operational Definitions

It is important to establish what we define as a family. The literature varies on what is considered a family. For the purposes of this study a family will be broadly defined as a composition of two or more persons who are brought together over time by mutual consent who, together, assume responsibilities for familial functions \(Benzies and Mychasiuk, 2009; Vanier Institute of the Family 2004\). For the purposes of our study a couple must be cohabitating but not necessarily married. 

When determining the appropriate period of time to consider "post-deployment" I refer to the Yellow Ribbon Reintegration Program, which describes post-deployment is the first 180 days after the service member returns to their home station. 

### Possible Interview Questions

A question that remains unanswered is how does the process of reintegration mirror the process of separation? Are there similar fears and difficulties experienced when a service member cones back from deployment?

**Guiding Question**: what is the lived experience of the military couple dyad navigating post-deployment life?

**Possible Questions**

* How long have you been in a relationship together?
* How long have you been married?
* Branch of Service
* SM: Years in service
* Most recent deployment
* SM: How many times have you deployed during your career?
* SM: Did you experience any combat during deployment?
* Do you have children? 
* What has been the hardest part of your re-adjusting to life at home after your most recent deployment?
* What was the best part of your re-adjusting to life at home after your most recent deploymennt?
* Were there any specific skills that you tried to use to ease the transition from deployment to post-deployment?
* Did you receive any formal training \(such as STRONG BONDS\) on how to work through post-deployment difficulties?
* What were your main sources of support during the post-deployment phase?
* Were there any patterns you noticed across the times you came back from a deployment? 
  * Did they get easier or harder each time?
* What do you feel you've learned about your relationship as a result of your latest deployment?
