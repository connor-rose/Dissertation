# Methods 26 MAY 2017
* I could do the **Marek and D'aniello** article (**SM N=380) (Civ= 295) **method which is collect data from non-linked service mems and civ partners. Their article specifically said that reworking their methodology with linked couples would be better though. 
* Looking at **Larsen et al (Army wives)** **(N=18)** they did a qual study using IPA. This could be a good approach to emulate but they only looked at one memver of the dyad (civ partner). 
* Mixed Methods Idea (pp. 66 of RNB): do qual interviews about coping strats, protective factors utilzied during post-deployment and use quant marital sat survey. Look for rlx between protective facrtors, coping, and marital sat
### Methodology
The qualitative approach used in this study will be interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA). IPA attempts to explore one's personal experience with the world around them and is concerned with the individuals perception of an event (Smith, 2015). In the case of this study we are attempting to understand the military couples perception of life as they re-integrate into life at home after a deployment. The researchers are not attempting to make an objective statement regarding re-integration itself but rather we are trying to bring light to the unique subjective experience of the military couple. An acknowledgment that is made when utilizing IPA methodology is that there are two layers of interpretation involved in any sort of data gathering. There is the participant attempting to the understand their world and there is the researcher attempting to understand the participant who is attempting to understand their world. This dual layer of abstraction is called a *double hermeneutic* It is the reason a researcher chooses to focus their inquiry on the perception of the participant rather than trying to gain an objective understanding of the world. 
Lastly, IPA is an idiographic approach to research as opposed to a nomothetic approach (Smith, 2015). That is to say, IPA is more interested in the detailed examination of a particular case. In this study, that detailed examination is focused on one specific part of the overall deployment cycle of which a military couple is navigating. We are interested in what is happening for the military couple at the point in time when the service member has returned home and is attempting to navigate family life and re-connect with their civilian partner. 
### Social Location and Researcher Bias
As the researcher conducting the participant interviews and performing the coding of transcripts, it is important to be aware of where I am approaching the research from as well as making the reader aware of possible biases I may have. I have taken steps to become aware of and minimize the influence that my biases may have on the research however, it is impossible to completely sever oneself from their biases**CITATIN**. At the time of data collection and interpretation the primary student researcher had joined the Air Force and upon completion of their doctorate degree will be working as a clinical psychologist in an active duty capacity. The possibility for bias to enter the data collection is at the point of data encoding. Given my affiliation with the Air Force it is possible to want to over-analyze or otherwise focus too closely on the positive aspects that result from a military life. Their is currently minimal research on the positive aspects of being a member of the military community which is why this paper chooses to focus, in part, on those positive factors. 
### Participants and Recruitment
Requirements of participants is to be either a) a partnered service member of any military branch who has been deployed within the last two years or b) a partner of a SM who was deployed within the last two years. Participants may, but are not necessarily from, a linked dyad. Participants will be asked if they and their partner would like to be a part of an additional interview component. The purpose of the interview is to gather additional information that is only possible from in-person interviews.
**give details of the participants to help conceptualize results**
Sampling methods will include snowball sampling methods as well as reaching out to local community organizations involved in supporting military families. After making contact with initial military couples, we hope to utilize "friends of friends" and "word of mouth" to gather a sufficient number of participants. 
*Proposal Specifics*
* Close contacts
* National Guard contacts
* local community events
	### Operational Definitions
It is important to establish what we define as a family. The literature varies on what is considered a family. For the purposes of this study a family will be defined as a composition of two or more persons who are brought together over time by mutual consent who, together, assume responsibilities for familial functions (Benzies and Mychasiuk, 2009; Vanier Institute of the Family 2004). For the purposes of our study a couple must be cohabitating but not necessarily married.
When determining the appropriate period of time to consider "post-deployment" I will refer to the Yellow Ribbon Reintegration Program, which describes post-deployment is the first 180 days after the service member returns to their home station.
### Data Collection
Data collection will be done via a qualitative survey sent out to participants gathered from sources stated above. For those participants who are willing, a qualitative interview will be conducted to gather additional information.
* talks about survey structure and format
* include question samples
* mention bracketing again just because
### Interview Questions
A question that remains unanswered is how does the process of reintegration mirror the process of separation? Are there similar fears and difficulties experienced when a service member cones back from deployment?
**Guiding Question**: what is the lived experience of the military couple dyad navigating post-deployment life?
**Possible Questions**
* How long have you been in a relationship together?
* Are you married? If so, for how long?
* Branch of Service?
* SM: Years in service
* age, gender, rank
* Date range of most recent deployment
* SM: How many times have you deployed during your career?
* SM: Did you experience any combat during your latest deployment?
* Do you have children? 
Pulling from Larsen et al these questions are broken up into three domains: individual level processes, family beliefs/practices, and sociocultrual processes.

**Individual Level**
* What were your main sources of support during the post-deployment phase?
* Were there any patterns in the coming home process that you noticed across your multiple deployments?
* Were there any stressors that were salient for you and your partner when you (they) came home from deployment i.e. finances, chores, sexual frustration, loneliness etc.?
* What has been the hardest part of your re-adjusting to life at home after your (partner's) most recent deployment?
* What was the best part of your re-adjusting to life at home after your (partner's) most recent deployment?
  - Alternative to 2 above: what have been the most salient experiences of your being back at home after deployment?
* In what ways has you and your family prepared for life after deployment?
**Family Beliefs/Practices**
* Did your family receive any formal training (such as STRONG BONDS) on how to work through post-deployment difficulties?
* What do you feel you've learned about your relationship as a result of your latest deployment?
* How does military culture fit with your families culture?
* What was communication like for you and your partner when (you) they got back from deployment?

**Sociocultural Processes**
* What were your main sources of support during the post-deployment phase?
* Did social support from friends or family play a role in the coming home process?* * {If multiple deployments} Were there any patterns in the coming home process that were consistent across multiple deployments? 
  - Did the coming home process change over the multiple deployments?
* What do you feel you've learned about your relationship as a result of your latest deployment?
