Data collection will be done via a qualitative survey sent out to list servs and friends of friends (snow ball sampling). Requirements of participants is to be either a partnered service member who has deployed within the last two years(?) or a civilian partner of SM who has deployed within the last two years. Participants may, but are not necessarily from, a linked dyad. Participants will be asked if they and their partner would like to be a part of an additional interview component. The purpose of the interview is to gather additional information that is only possible from in-person interviews. 
* I could do the **Marek and D'aniello** article (**SM N=380) (Civ= 295)Â **method which is collect data from non-linked service mems and civ partners. Their article specifically said that reworking their methodology with linked couples would be better though. 
* Looking at **Larsen et al (Army wives)** **(N=18)** they did a qual study using IPA. This could be a good approach to emulate but they only looked at one memver of the dyad (civ partner). 
* Mixed Methods Idea (pp. 66 of RNB): do qual interviews about coping strats, protective factors utilzied during post-deployment and use quant marital sat survey. Look for rlx between protective facrtors, coping, and marital sat.
snow ball sampling of active duty and veteran couples. Must have one deployment? Or include couples with no deployment to examine the difference in stressors between deploy and no deploy couples?

### Participants and Recruitment
* Austin's relatives?
* Tabling at the VA
* Couples of all branches, 2 year since last deployment, combat not required
* National Guard contacts of Alexa Landsman
* local community event

### Social Location and Researcher Bias
As the researcher conducting the participant interviews and performing the coding of transcripts, it is important to be aware of where I am approaching the research from as well as making the reader aware of possible biases I may have. I have taken steps to become aware of and minimize the influence that my biases may have on the research however, it is impossible to completely sever oneself from their biases. At the time of data collection and interpretation the primary student researcher had joined the Air Force and upon completion of their doctorate degree will be working as a clinical psychologist in an active duty capacity. The possibility for bias to enter the data collection is at the point of data encoding. Given my affiliation with the Air Force it is possible to want to over-analyze or otherwise focus too closely on the positive aspects that result from a military life. Their is currently minimal research on the positive aspects of being a member of the military community which is why this paper chooses to focus, in part, on those positive factors. 
  
### Operational Definitions
It is important to establish what we define as a family. The literature varies on what is considered a family. For the purposes of this study a family will be broadly defined as a composition of two or more persons who are brought together over time by mutual consent who, together, assume responsibilities for familial functions (Benzies and Mychasiuk, 2009; Vanier Institute of the Family 2004). For the purposes of our study a couple must be cohabitating but not necessarily married.
When determining the appropriate period of time to consider "post-deployment" I refer to the Yellow Ribbon Reintegration Program, which describes post-deployment is the first 180 days after the service member returns to their home station.

### Possible Interview Questions
A question that remains unanswered is how does the process of reintegration mirror the process of separation? Are there similar fears and difficulties experienced when a service member cones back from deployment?
**Guiding Question**: what is the lived experience of the military couple dyad navigating post-deployment life?
**Possible Questions**
* How long have you been in a relationship together?
* Are you married? If so, for how long?
* Branch of Service
* SM: Years in service
* age, gender, rank
* Most recent deployment
* SM: How many times have you deployed during your career?
* SM: Did you experience any combat during deployment?
* Do you have children? 

Pulling from Larsen et al these questions are broken up into three domains: individual level processes, family beliefs/practices, and sociocultrual processes

**Individual Level**
* What were your main sources of support during the post-deployment phase?
* Were there any patterns in the coming home process that you noticed across your multiple deployments?
* Were there any stressors that were salient for you and your partner when you (they) came home from deployment i.e. finances, chores, sexual frustration, loneliness etc.
* What has been the hardest part of your re-adjusting to life at home after your most recent deployment?
* What was the best part of your re-adjusting to life at home after your most recent deploymennt?
  * ALT to 2 above: what have been the most salient experiences of your being back at home after deployment?
* How did you (and your family if civ) prepare for life after deployment?

**Family Beliefs/Practices**
* Did your family receive any formal training (such as STRONG BONDS) on how to work through post-deployment difficulties
* What do you feel you've learned about your relationship as a result of your latest deployment?
* How does deployment and the military fit into your family?
* what was communication like for you and your partner when they got back from deployment?

**Sociocultural Processes**
* did social support from friends or family play a role in the coming home process?
* What were your main sources of support during the post-deployment phase?
* Were there any patterns you noticed across the times you(your partner) came back from a deployment? 
  * Did the coming home process change over the years?
* What do you feel you've learned about your relationship as a result of your latest deployment?
