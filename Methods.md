### Methodology
`cite IPA model and double hermenutic`
The qualitative approach used in this study will be interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA). IPA attempts to explore one's personal experience with the world around them and is concerned with the individuals perception of an event (Smith, 2015). In the case of this study we are attempting to understand the military couples experience as they re-integrate into life at home after a deployment. The researchers are not attempting to make an objective statement regarding re-integration itself but rather we are trying to bring light to the unique subjective experience of the military couple. An acknowledgment that is made when utilizing IPA methodology is that there are two layers of interpretation involved in any sort of data gathering. There is the participant attempting to understand their world and there is the researcher attempting to understand the participant who is attempting to understand their world. This dual layer of abstraction is called a *double hermeneutic* It is the reason a researcher chooses to focus their inquiry on the perception of the participant rather than trying to gain an objective understanding of the world.
Lastly, IPA is an idiographic approach to research as opposed to a nomothetic approach (Smith, 2015). That is to say, IPA is more interested in the detailed examination of a particular case. In this study, that detailed examination is focused on one specific part of the overall deployment cycle of which a military couple is navigating. We are interested in what is happening for the military couple at the point in time when the service member has returned home and is attempting to navigate family life and re-connect with their civilian partner. 
### Social Location and Researcher Bias
As the researcher conducting the participant interviews and performing the coding of transcripts, it is important to be aware of my entry point into the research as well as making the reader aware of possible biases I may have. I have taken steps to become aware of and minimize the influence that my biases may have on the research however, it is impossible to completely sever oneself from one's biases. At the time of data collection and interpretation the primary student researcher will have joined the Air Force and upon completion of his doctorate degree will be working as a clinical psychologist in an active duty capacity. Given my affiliation with the Air Force it is possible to want to over-analyze or otherwise focus too closely on the positive aspects that result from a military life. 
That being said, my own closeness to the research can have positive impacts as well. For starters, being a member, even at a broad level, of the group in which I am attempting to understand gives me a certain amount of credibility with that group. There is an opportunity for me to be seen as less of an outsider probing for information and more as a curious member of the in-group. Being a member of the military and researching the experience of other members of the military means I have an interest in seeing my participants represented fairly and will do my best to ensure that happens. 
Regardless of the benefits and risks of my affiliation with the Air Foece it is important to take steps to minimize the impact of any bias on the research process. To address potential bias, I will first engage in bracketing. Bracketing is the practice of mitigating preconceptions that the researcher may have towards the research subjects or the data. It is an attempt by the researcher to build and maintain self-awareness surrounding their role as a research tool and how they can impact the interpretation of qualitative data (Tufford and Newman, 2012). Bracketing is a process that the researcher engages in throughout the research project. Additionally, there will be a research assistant involved in the transcription and analysis process who is not affiliated with the military and a Pacific University faculty member overseeing this project who is also not affiliated with the military`.awkward sentence`
### Participants `use language from IRB forms for participant eligibilty requirements`
Participants are required to meet the following requirements for participation: be a) a partnered service member (SM) of any military branch in the United States Armed Forces who has been deployed within the last two years (at time of participation) or b) a partner of a service member who was deployed within the last two years and who were co-habitating at the time o post-deployment. All participants must be at least 18 years of age and have access to the internet in order to complete an online qualitative survey. The justification for a two year cut-off following deployment is necessary to ensure adequate recall of the re-integration process.
### Procedure
In this study, the emphasis is on understanding the lived experience of a military couple during the post-deployment phase. Pending IRB approval, we will be utilizing a qualitative survey to gather this information. A qualitative survey is the most appropriate method for data collection because it allows us to ask open-ended questions while also reaching a wide sample size when compared to doing in-person interviews. Recruitment will take place through online postings and listserv postings for organizations relevant to the topic of interest as well as through utilization of current personal military community contacts of the research team. The online sources include but are not limited to The APA Division 19 listserv, military.com (support website for military members and families), and milspouse.com (a support website for military spouses). No incentives will be offered. Participants will also be recruited through personal contacts including friends and family currently serving in the military or with knowledge of eligible participants, members of the Oregon Reserve National Guard, and the secondary networks of those primary contacts. The recruitment message that will be distributed via email or online posting will contain a brief statement regarding the purpose of the survey, inclusion criteria for participants, and a link or QR code that will take the participant directly to the survey should they choose to participate. To avoid misperception of affiliation, the recruitment message will also include a statement that this study is not connected with the Department of Defense or any other defense agency and that it is completely voluntary if individuals choose to participate. A detailed informed consent will be included at the beginning of the survey prior to any data collection.

The time frame for recruitment is October 2017 to April 2018. Sampling methods will include snowball sampling methods as well as reaching out to local community organizations involved in supporting military families. After making contact with initial military couples, we hope to utilize "friends of friends" and "word of mouth" to gather a sufficient number of participants. The number of participants is determined by data saturation, estimated at 18 participants. This number was determined by examining the participant totals for similar qualitative studies (i.e. Larsen et al, 2015) and by taking into account the resources and capabilities of the researcher.

The survey will be run on a private Qualtrics survey account accessible only by the research team consisting of myself, the two faculty supervisors, and a research assistant. The survey is to begin with an introduction to the survey structure and the informed consent. After agreeing to participate the first page of questions will be basic demographic questions, detailed below. After demographics, the survey will include three open-ended questions each covering the broad theme of information we intend to gather. The question that guides the construction of the following survey items is as follows: What is the lived experience of the military couple navigating the homecoming process in post-deployment life?

The research questions of this study are based on the findings of a qualitative study by Larsen et al (2015). The study was attempting to identify protective factors involved in spousal deployment as it was perceived by Army wives. In doing so the authors identified three domains that their findings were grouped into: individual coping, family beliefs/practices, and sociocultural processes. In developing our research questions for the current study we used these three domains as reference points for the development of our questions. 
*Individual Coping*
At the individual level the protective actors that exist surround acculturation, the development of individual purpose in a partners deployment, and being able to express emotion. It was reported that being able to acculturate to the new demands of a military lifestyle was foundational to the participants ability to connect with other spouses and adopt new norms, beliefs, and practices. For the current study, we are interested in seeing how that individual process of acculturation plays out in the homecoming process where service members and their partners are tasked with re-acculturating to a new family life with  different beliefs and practices when compared to life before deployment. 
*Family Beliefs/Practices*
Aspects of this domain include communicating, role flexibility, emotional regulation, problem solving, and creating shared meaning. In Larsen et al's findings one participant is quoted as feeling that her relationship grew stronger during deployment due to the nature of the communication while the service member was overseas (2015). By only being able to talk to each other the couple was able to learn more about each other and gain new insights. Role flexibility refers to how the partners delegate household functions during deployment. Being able to work together without becoming defensive was found to be key to effective management of the deployment. Constructing meaning in the context of Larsen et al's study refers to a couple's ability to find mutual benefit from deployment. Many spouses cited deployment as "testing the depth of the spousal bond and proved it's strength" (Larsen, 2015). 
*Sociocultural Processes*
In the context of deployment, social support helped spouses feel understood and connected with fellow military spouses. This feeling of understanding aided them in being able to navigate deployment stateside. These social supports came in the form of both formal support such as organized groups and informal support such as causal meetings with friends. 
These three domains, individual coping, family beliefs/practices, and sociocultural processes provide insight into the deployment experience of Army wives. By utilizing Larsen et al's findings the current study can ground its survey questions in previous research findings. 
After completing the survey participants will be debriefed, offered resources for military couples support services and/or reintegration services and thanked for their participation and service. This survey is an anonymous survey unless participants agree to a skype interview and provide contact information in which case the survey information will become confidential. Contact information will be removed from survey data and stored separately thus only accessible by the primary researcher. This contact information will be stored in a encrypted Box online storage account. After data collection the survey responses will be coded and analyzed by myself and a research assistant who is a graduate student from Pacific University. 
### Data Analysis
After survey completion, responses will be collected and preserved verbatim for analysis. According to IPA theory, the process of analyzing qualitative responses is to begin at the detailed idiographic level and focus on one case at a time before moving to a more broad level generalization of concepts between transcripts (Smith, 2015). Re-reading is imperative in becoming familiar with the text. This is why the researcher will read through the survey responses of one participant several times to get an overall feel for them. Consecutive pass through helps make sense of the text and aid in gaining additional insight into its meaning. This will be done for all responses before any coding occurs. After that, the researcher will return to the individual survey responses to begin coding. Statements pertaining to the lived experience of being a military couple will be focused on and coded for their meaning. These codes should be directly related to the meaning of the text it is meant to represent. While still focusing on one survey response, these codes are to be clustered by similarity and given a theme. This theme is more abstract than codes but should still connect back to the primary source material. As themes are identified they too will be clustered together to identify which themes are primary themes and which are subthemes. During this phase it is important to refer back to the source material often to ensure commonality of themes is supported by the text. This process is repeated for each survey response. As you progress across surveys, the researcher is looking for themes that emerge among multiple survey responses. These common themes are the results of the qualitative investigation.
To account for the possibility of a disparity in the amount of survey responses between service members and partners, survey responses will be analyzed in a one-to-one fashion in an attempt to maintain equal number of both participant types (SM and partner). Data will be analyzed as it is collected until a saturation of themes is reached. Saturation of themes is identified as the point in data analyses when no new themes emerge for two consecutive interviews as agreed upon by two or more researchers. By analyzing survey responses as data is collected we are able to avoid collecting unnecessary data thus ensuring that data is only collected as long as it is needed in order to reach thematic saturation.
