# Discussion
This study is attempting to understand the lived experiences of military couple re-integrating during the stage of deployment known as *post-deployment*. The hope was to gain information about what each of member of the couple saw as challenges and as positives in the experience of re-integrating.
- `Find the patterns and relationships in the results`
- A pattern that was uncovered in our findings was that adaptability, flexibility, and patience were among the most common strengths cited by both service members and their partners. The challenges most often cited by participants  
- `analyze unexpected findings`
- `limitations and weaknesses`
- `concise summary of the principal implications of the findings regardless of significance`
- `recommendations: none that could have been easily addressed in my study.`
Most often mentioned strengths were being adaptable, flexible, patient, and suportive. These responses were seen from both service members and partners. Flexibility was also mentioned in one response as a necessary trait for military service members. One consideration is that flexibility is a trait that is seen more often in service members because of their lack of control that results from working in the military. This would consequently benefit the post-deployment process. An interesting strength that was provided by one service member was “self-restraint.” It is unclear exactly what he meant however one interpretation is that he is referring to his ability to hold back negative emotions or to compartmentalize in order to avoid negative interactions with his partner. 
The biggest challenges were learning to re-adjust roles in the household, adjusting to the personal growth that took place within both the partner and service member during deployment, and the overall time that it takes for the post-deployment process to happen. 
In terms of family beliefs and practices, service member responses were sparse. They provided minimal information. Partners however, gave more detailed responses and examples to this question. This leaves us wondering as to why there would be such a discrepancy between partners and service member’s responses. \*\*\*\*\* What was mentioned in family beliefs was the importance of finding a rhythm as a couple. Both service member and partner mentioned the effort required to understand each other again. {check on how this related to research}. `how well did respnodents answer this question the way we expected? Was the question written poorly?` 
Interestingly, when discussing supports, service members did not mention family in any way. However, partners mentioned family as a support both for themselves and their service members. 
Communication was seen as both a positive and negative thing. `research about this?`
- Church versus professional resource utilization
- add in the one female service members who didn’t meet criteria.
- “the combat deployment was helpful” statement
When asked about support resources that the participants utilized we found that participants oft mentioned church as a resource. What participants did not mention was any professional resources such as DoD sponsored programs or therapists, counselors, etc. 

2) Research that supports the findings?
3) Unexpected Findings?
- combat as beneficial
	- Metnion the mentions of church as a support and lack of mention of professional supports
4) Female S.M. Findings
5) One SM with PTSD and moral injury
