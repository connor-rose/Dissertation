# Discussion
This study is attempting to understand the lived experiences of military couple re-integrating during the stage of deployment known as *post-deployment*. The hope was to gain information about what each of member of the couple saw as challenges and as positives in the experience of re-integrating. At a theoretical level this study is unique due to the specific inclusion of questions that asked about strengths and elicited explanation of positive factors of managing a deployment. The intent was to contribute to the growing body of literature surrounding positive aspects of deployment.
- `Find the patterns and relationships in the results`
- A pattern that was uncovered in our findings was that adaptability, flexibility, and patience were among the most common strengths cited by both service members and their partners. The fact that both service members and partners identified these traits as strengths of both themselves and their partners is evidence that these traits are paramount to successful reintegration. They were important enough to be identified in both types of partners. Flexibility was also mentioned in one response as a necessary trait for military service members. One consideration, which was mentioned in one partner’s response, is that flexibility is a trait that is seen more often in service members because of their lack of control that results from working in the military. This would consequently benefit the post-deployment process.
- The biggest challenges were learning to re-adjust roles in the household, adjusting to the personal growth that took place within both the partner and service member during deployment, and the overall time that it takes for the post-deployment process to happen. 
- When asked about support resources that the participants utilized we found that participants oft mentioned church as a resource. What participants did not mention was any professional resources such as DoD sponsored programs or therapists, counselors, etc. 

- `analyze unexpected findings`
- When asked about strengths, one service member mentioned his “self-restraint” as a strength. He did not give any further elaboration so it is difficult to know what he meant by this. It is unclear exactly what he meant however one interpretation is that he is referring to his ability to hold back negative emotions or to compartmentalize in order to avoid negative interactions with his partner. This behavior has been noted in service members who have difficulty adapting to the transition into civilian life `(reference)` 
- Interestingly, when discussing supports, service members did not mention family in any way. However, partners mentioned family as a support both for themselves and their service members. 
- Communication was seen as both a positive and negative thing. `research about this?`
- Church versus professional resource utilization
-  “the combat deployment was helpful” statement
4) Female S.M. Findings
5) One SM with PTSD and moral injury
- Female SM who did not meet co-hab criteria
- `limitations and weaknesses`
- difficulty in finding service members. 
- find ways to obtain more female service members and male partners to increase representability. 
- In terms of family beliefs and practices, service member responses were sparse. They provided minimal information. Partners however, gave more detailed responses and examples to this question. This leaves us wondering as to why there would be such a discrepancy between partners and service member’s responses.  `how well did respnodents answer this question the way we expected? Was the question written poorly?` 
- had to expand inclusion criteria mid way through the data collection process to allow any couples deployed since 9/11 to be eligible
- `concise summary of the principal implications of the findings regardless of significance`
- Interestingly, service member responses were short and concise, with little elaboration. Partner’s responses were more expansive, with more detail. The implications for the research are that, with all things being equal, service member responses provide less information and less insight than do partner responses. Future studies may want to consider trying to recruit higher number of service members to counteract their tendency for more spartan responses.
- Some responses identified positives to come out of deployment. This data can add to the growing body of literature that speaks to the positive aspects of when a couple is able to navigate a deployment. `reference Person who stated combat made us stronger (Rutgers Dissertation citation “relationship is stronger” data)`

- `recommendations: none that could have been easily addressed in my study.`
