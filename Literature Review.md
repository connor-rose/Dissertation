## Number of Service Members With Families
 54.3% of active duty personnel are married, with 6.4% being dual-military marriages. 41.1% of those marriages have children. The average age of a married service member is 31.8. (MIL One Source link; DMDC link) Active duty divorces as of 2015 was 1.6%. This is lower than the national average of XXXXX%. Given the unique stressors of military life it is imperative to understand why military marriages have less likelihood of ending in divorce. 
## Deployment Cycle
A military deployment consists of several stages. The model we are referencing is that used by the Yellow Ribbon Reintegration Program, one of the many programs in the Joint Service Support Network aimed at providing support to all service members and their families (Joint Services Program, n.d.) 
First their is pre-deployment, this is from a SM's first notification of deployment until deployment occurs. Second there is the deployment phase: from departure until demobilization. Demobilization is the third stage where the units arrive at the demobilization station and it lasts until they arrive at their home station. This is the point in the deployment where the service member is no longer deployed but still not reunited with their families. Last is the Post-deployment stage: this is the arrival at home through 180 days after arrival. 
This is where the service member and their family begin the process of rejoining each other and it is the stage of deployment that this study will focus on. In post-deployment the family unit is progressing through the various challenges and joys that accompany this process. There is a general paucity of literature focused on reintegration of the military couple as a single unit. Most research is done on one member of a military couple. Of the studies that gather data from both a service member and their civilian partner it is not collected from both members of a single dyad. Data collection occurs without regard for having both members of a single dyad present (Marek, 2014).
Life in the military is both a rewarding and stressful experience for service members and their partner. Being in the military means being in a constant state of readiness to either deploy or relocate. Managing a deployment cycle involves heightened occupational stressors for the service member and an increase in familial roles and expectations for the civilian partner. Both the service member and the spouse, when reunited after a deployment, are different people than when they separated. 
## Stressors of Military Life
For some military families the act of reintegrating after a deployment is challenging. Military families are used to challenges but reintegration comes with it's own unique difficulties. Researchers have found that after returning home from a combat deployment some service members find it difficult to find something in their lives as meaningful as the life and death missions they conducted overseas (Bowling and Sherman, 2007). 
In conjunction with the search for meaning, some service members also return home with mental health complications (Marek and D'Aniello, 2014; Newby, 2005). The numbers have varied over the years but Marek and D'Aniello discovered that 70% of service members across the branches returning home from a deployment cite PTSD as having a moderate level of interference in their life. Another 22% stated that it interferes with their lives a lot. When partners of military service members were asked the same question, 100% of the partners said that PTSD had at least a moderate impact on their family. These numbers speak to the high impact that deployment has on a military couples ability to successfully reintegrate into family life post-deployment. Other aspects of deployment that service members have found difficult include working within the chain of command, being away from home, and deterioration of their significant relationships (Newby, 2005).
On the home front the civilian spouse of a military couple encounters their own unique challenges during a deployment. Frequent transitions across bases, the fear of being alone while the partner is on deployment coupled with a struggle to become close again after deployment are a few examples. Uncertainty about military partners safety and rumination about the precariousness of the occupation were some others. Finding a support network after becoming a military partner is challenging as well. The women in this study stated that their civilian friends no longer understood them and trying to integrate into the hierarchy of the army wife life is strenuous (Larsen, Clauss-Ehlers, and Cosden, 2015).
The process of preparing for a deployment is full of complex emotions. One military spouse described it as "this fear of being alone was coupled with the struggle to experience closeness during this difficult time, while also needing distance to cope with the emotional difficulty of an impending departure" (Larsen, 2015). This quote exemplifies the difficulties that precipitate the impending departure of a military service member. Other stressors for the spouse include perceptions and assumptions about the level of danger encountered by the military spouse ad well as difficulties in finding a supportive community and in-group that can serve as a form of social support. 
## Post-deployment Stressors
Marek and D'Aniello (2014) investigated the presence of post-deployment stressors for military service members and non-linked partners of service members (i.e. participants were not members of the same dyad). What these researchers found was that both the presence of mental health symptoms of the service member and the partner's perception of their mental health symptoms had an impact on a couple's ability to effectively navigate the post-deployment experience. Both partners and service member's perception of the others mental health has an impact on the couple's stress levels. The strategy to combat this stress would be open communication which is an activity often cited as difficult for re-integrating couples to achieve. 
Their are many tasks involved in reintegrating and dealing with the stressors of post-deployment life. A few of these key tasks are a) managing/redefining roles and expectations, and Division of Household Responsibilities; b) Creating Intimacy in Relationships; and c) Creating a Sense of Shared Meaning Surrounding the Deployment Experience (Bowling and Sherman, 2008). 
During deployment the spouse is the sole proprietor of the house and upon the return, the service member may feel like they no longer fit into the family routine. Navigating the redefining of roles can be a difficult feat to accomplish. Flexibility and communication are paramount to that success (Bowling and Sherman, 2008). 
Building those connections with your partner is key to reintegration success. Self disclosure is seen as one way for couples to come together and connect interpersonally. Self-disclosure can be hard for the service member because soldiers may feel they can only be understood by fellow soldiers (Cox, 2012). Additionally soldiers are seen as the “rock” of the family and are considered strong burden bearers and therefore may less open to vulnerable communication. This open communication is also important in creating the shared meaning of deployment mentioned above. Being able to foster family cohesion through shared meaning has the potential to aid the service member in feeling wanted as a part of the family and it can help the civilian partner feel like they gained something out of the deployment (Bowling and Sherman, 2008).
## Positive Outcomes of Deployment
Historically much of the literature is focused on the negative consequences of a military deployment. In some areas of burgeoning literature however, couples do cite positive outcomes of navigating a military deployment. A deployment can be a time to test the strength of the relationship by forcing meaningful and conversations and building deeper connections between the partners. In an investigation of utilizing CBT couple's therapy during reintegration, Sayers (2010) found that 9% of married service members reported an improvement of their relationship with their spouse as a result of deployment. Another study that followed a unit assigned to peacekeeping missions in Europe found 77% percent of soldiers reporting some kind of benefit as a result of deployment. The three most reported benefits were: making additional money, self-improvement, and "time to think" (Newby, 2005).
## State of The Literature
There is a general lack of evidence that wartime deployment has a universally negative impact on marital satisfaction and stability (Sayers, 2010). This is supported by research that focuses on the coping methods utilized by military spouses during the deployment phase of the deployment cycle. Larsen identified coping strategies utilized by Army wives that center around three general domains: individual coping, family beliefs, and sociocultural processes. Moreover, Larsen et al. (2015) found that if couples were able to find meaning in the deployment such as belief in the overall mission or viewing the stressors of deployment as a way to strengthen the relationship, couples were more likely to view a deployment positively. One of the obstacles to a comprehensive understanding of family resilience is the lack of integration and synthesis of the main risk and protective factors that influence outcomes (Benzies and Mychiasiuk, 2009). For example, in one particular study the researchers found that service members with greater military experience, defined as years in service and a family history of service, did not report less stress during reintegration (Allen, Rhoades, Stanley, & Markman, 2011). This finding is inconsistent with prior literature and exemplifies the necessity of parsing out the details of lived experience of mil families to better understand their experiences.
What the literature does say is that there are a number of identified protective factors that can increase a families potential for resilience. First, Benzies and Mychiasiuk (2009) found that smaller family sizes, families with older mothers, and dual income households experiences less stress and have a greater capacity to be resilient when compared to larger families, families with younger mothers, and single income families. Benzies and Mychiasiuk also found that social support from ones partner enhances a couples ability to cope with social and economic stressors. This is consistent with Allen, Rhoades, Stanley, & Markman (2011) who found that couples reporting high levels of negative communication and more negative "spill-over" between work and the relationship had high levels of stress. Allen et al. found that Army couples who were able to talk about Army related stressors reported higher marital satisfaction. These findings suggest that social support via the romantic partnership is crucial to managing various types of life stressors. It is important to understand what social support in a romantic relationship looks like. Benzies and Mychusiak (2009) define familial social support as "interpersonal interactions within a family structure, that provides support or tangible help." 
The current state of the literature surrounding familial stress is not always consistent with the literature surrounding military families. Benzies and Mychusiak examined familial resilience from a general perspective while Allen, Rhoades, Stanley and Markman collected data specifically on Army couples. While Benzies and Mychusiak found social support to be vital in dealing with familial stress, Allen et al (2011) found that interpersonal connections within Army families did not correlate with familial stress. Rather it was the sense of needing social support and not having it, or not knowing where to find it, that was correlated with increased stress. If families knew how to get social support if it was needed, they reported lower levels of stress in the relationship. By looking at both the consistencies and the dissparities between general family resilience literature and the literature focused on Army couples we can see that while certain evidence for protective factors and stressors found in general family systems holds true for military families, this is not always the case. It stands to reason that the unique situation military families live in creates unique stressors as well as unique protective factors, both of which thus far have not been explored in the literature with enough detail.
## Current Contribution
The intention of this study is to build on the work that has already been done in the field of military couples research and to provide a unique approach to understanding the lives of military couples as they reintegrate their lives following a deployment. The stress of reintegration impacts family members and family units differently and thus it is necessary to investigate each of those components of the family structure separately (Marek, 2014). By attempting to understand the *lived experience* of the military couple *as a dyad* and through a qualitative lens, we are hoping to gain valuable information surrounding both the challenges of reintegrating together but also the positive protective factors that make reintegration easier and more meaningful. Better understanding of how a couple deals with and reacts to stressful events can provide insight into what is detrimental and what is strengthening for military couples. Repeated exposure to stress may be valuable learning experiences for couples that leads to maturation and learning (Palmer, 2008).
