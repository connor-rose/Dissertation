#Literature Review1
There are many aspects of military life that are in opposition to the development of a healthy relationship with an intimate partner: the need for secrecy, the perpetuation of stoicism and avoidance of vulnerability, the continual unknown of departure for and return from deployments (Cox, 2012). Additionally, the cycle of deployment has been shown to double the stress for the civilian partner in a military family when compared to the partner of a non-deployed military member. Conversely, there are aspects of military life that strengthen members of a military family. Repeated exposure to stress can lead to maturation and learning (Palmer, 2008). This study will focus on the specific point of the deployment cycle known as reintegration. This is the point in time after a military deployment overseas when the warrior has to reintegrate into civilian life and into their family structures after a year or more away from home. 

There are many challenges for a service member when they return home. If they have a partner in an intimate relationship and possibly a family, these difficulties are felt by the other family members as well. Prior research has identified many of the service members difficulties, such as redefining roles, expectations, and household chores; managing emotions; re-creating intimacy with the partner; and creating shared meaning around the deployment experience (Bowling & Sherman, 2008). While these activities can be difficult for the military couple, if met with success it can be empowering. Bowling and Sherman have done a good job of identifying the challenges of reintegration but they have not collected information on the couple's experiential aspect of grappling with these challenges. 

Benzies (2009) conducted a literature review identifying key protective factors involved in fostering family resilience. Benzies identified family resilience as the ability of a family to respond positiviely to adverse events and emerge strengthened, more resourceful, and more confident. Benzies (2009) identified three traits that are key in strengthening resilience: cooperation, mutual support between partners, and familial commitment to each other. Below I will highlight the key protective factors identified by the authors. 

In terms of family structure Benzies (2009) found that smaller families had less financial strain than larger families. It was also found that families with older mothers have additional protective factors conferred onto their children.
Intimate partner relationship stability is defined as a stable relationship with good quality communication between the couple. Relationship stability provides a consistent environment for children and promotes healthy development. When the couple has a secure, loving dyadic relationship it demonstrates appropriate social interaction for the children and creates a secure environment for the children (2008). One of the most significant protective factors identified in Benzies literature review was family cohesion. Families were more likely to reach goals when adversity was faced together. 

Another key protective factor was found to be social support. This is congruent with other literature of protective factors for both familial and individual resilience **{CTATN HERE}**. Benzies (2008) found that social support was beneficial both when it was being received as well as when it was being provided to others. Social support was instrumental in times of stress to help the family stay physically and mentally helthy. It also helps buffer the negative effects of economic distress. 

Involvement in the community helps families participate in social networks, access to resources like local health care and education. If a family is involved in neighborhood activities and spiritual communities it helps to foster a sense of belonging and appreciation for their own community. 

Living in a safe neighborhood was found to be a protective factor because it prevented the family from having to deal with "social toxicity", that is, high crime rates, poor school districts, violence, and poor infrastructure. **{THNK ABT HOW BASE LOCATION PLAYS INTO THIS IDEA}** Access to quality health care is a protective factor by strengthening the family resilience and protecting high risk families.

Benzies states that preventive measures aimed at developing protective factors for families would be more cost effective than providing services when the family is in crisis **{THS Y RSRCH IS IMPRTNT}** 

Marek and D'Aniello (2014) wanted to examine the factors involved in positive outcomes and reduced stress during military family reintegration experiences. They used quantitative survey methods to identify factors of mental health that impacted stress levels of families going through reintegration. According to the authors, the perception of partners mental health was not congruent to the partners own perception of their mental health. Additionally these authors found that the perception of how much PTSD symptoms impacted the relationship was different for the service members and the partners of service members. This data suggests a difference in perception of the relationship which is congruent with increased reintegration stress in the family (Marek & D'Aniello, 2014). The authors assert that attending to the relational dynamics of the service member their partners in important for understanding the stressors experienced by military  families experiencing reintegration. That is what this study aims to do by obtaining qualitative data from military family dyads. Lastly Marek and D'Aniello stated that a limitation of their study was that data was collected from individuals rather than the linked dyads. This limited their ability to expand on any possible relationship elements between a specific couple. This study also supposed the assumption that every couple responds to reintegration stressors differently and therefore it should not be assumed that all military couples face hardship despite deployment.

Palmer (2008) suggests that the experiences of military families may or may not be detrimental. Palmer argues that it largely depends on how the parents react and interpret events such as continual relocation. Research focused on better understanding how a couple deals with and reacts to stress would be beneficial in providing insight into the experience of military couples as a singular unit. Research supports the position that exposure to stress may be a valualbe learning experience that can lead to positive growth and resilience (Bonanno, 2004; Adler, 2001; Jacelon, 1997; Melvin et al., 2012). Palmer asserts that there is a need for research that determines what aspects of military life develop strengths for the family and protect against negative events. 

Larsen (2015) looked at the protective factors that existed for Army wives coping with a partner deployment. The researcher conducted interviews with the civilian spouses to gather information about how they were coping with the challenges of deployment. The author found that the protective factors were grouped into three domains: individual coping, family beliefs and practices, and sociocultural processes (2015). Individual coping involves acculturating to military life and adopting new norms in an effort to garner support from the other Army spouses. Unfortunately for many of the participants becoming closer to the military culture made them more distant from their civilian family and friends, placing the spouses in a Catch 22. The domain of family beliefs and practices involve communication patterns with the military partner, role flexibility, emotion regulation, and creating meaning out of the events that take place during deployment. The key protective factor in the family beliefs domain is the ability to regulate emotions appropriately in response to shifting family dynamics during and after deployment. Another important protective factor is the ability to co-create meaning and benefit from a deployment. One participant found deployments as a way to test their relationship and challenge the depth of her connection with her spouse (Larsen, 2015). This is an example of positive experiences that can be derived form negative events. Lastly, sociocultural processes involve the social support aspect of being able to adjust to military life. The participants  described the necessity of finding support from the military spouse community due to their ability to have mutual understanding for the spousal experience. Larsen stated future areas of research being able to utilize these findings as a foundation for understanding the "lived experiences" of spousal deployment.
