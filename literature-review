Life in the military is both a rewarding and stressful experience for service members and their partner. Being in the military means being in a constant state of readiness to either deploy or relocate. Managing a deployment cycle involves heightened occupational stressors for the service member and an increase in familial roles and expectations for the civilian partner. Both the service member and the spouse, when reunited after a deployment, are different people than when they separated. 
## Stressors of Military Life
For some military families the act of reintegrating after a deployment is challenging. Military families are used to challenges but reintegration comes with it's own unique difficulties. Researchers have found that after returning home from a combat deployment some service members find it difficult to find something in their lives as meaningful as the life and death missions they conducted overseas (Bowling and Sherman, 2007). 
In conjunction with the search for meaning, some service members also return home with mental health complications (Marek and D'Aniello, 2014; Newby, 2005). The numbers have varied over the years but Marek and D'Aniello discovered that 70% of service members across the branches returning home from a deployment cite PTSD as having a moderate level of interference in their life. Another 22% stated that it interferes with their lives a lot. When partners of military service members were asked the same question, 100% of the partners said that PTSD had at least a moderate impact on their family. These numbers speak to the high impact that deployment has on a military couples ability to successfully reintegrate into family life post-deployment. Other aspects of deployment that service members have found difficult include working within the chain of command, being away from home, and deterioration of their significant relationships (Newby, 2005).
On the home front the civilian spouse of a military couple encounters their own unique challenges during a deployment. Frequent transitions across bases, the fear of being alone while the partner is on deployment coupled with a struggle to become close again after deployment are a few examples. Uncertainty about military partners safety and rumination about the precariousness of the occupation were some others. Finding a support network after becoming a military partner is challenging as well. The women in this study stated that their civilian friends no longer understood them and trying to integrate into the hierarchy of the army wife life is strenuous (Larsen, Clauss-Ehlers, and Cosden, 2015).
##Operational Definitions
families = any cohabitating couple; don't remember which article I found that in to support my decision

according to the Yellow Ribbon Reintegration Program, post deployment is the first 180 days after returning to your home station. 
## Number of Service Members With Families
## Deployment Cycle
A military deployment consists of several stages. The model we are referencing is that used by the Yellow Ribbon Reintegration Program, one of the many programs in the Joint Service Support Network aimed at providing support to all service members and their families (Joint Services Program, n.d.) First their is pre-deployment: from first notification of deployment until deployment occurs. This is the time where military families are preparing for the service members departure. This is the time where the couple tries to both engage each other emotionally while also preparing for imminent separation.
Second there is the deployment phase: from departure until demobilization. This is the time when units are deployed to their respective installations and given their assignments. Families are on the home front adjusting to the separation with the civilian spouse keeping the house hold functioning. 
Third is demobilization: this is from the units arrival at the demobilization station through their departure to their home station. This is the point in the deployment where the service member is no longer deployed but still not reunited with their families. They must go through various medical assessments and briefings before returning home to their families and their civilian duties. 
Last is the Post-deployment stage: this is the arrival at home through 180 days after arrival. This is where the service member and their family begin the process of rejoining each other as a family unit and progressing through the various challenges and joys that accompany that process. This study will focus on the post-deployment because this is where reintegration and readjustment occurs for the couple. There is a general paucity of literature focused on reintegration of the military couple as a single unit. Most research is done on one member of a military couple. Of the studies that gather data from both a service member and their civilian partner it is not collected from both members of a single dyad. Data collection occurs without regard for having both members of a single dyad present (Marek, 2014).
## Post-deployment Stressors
Marek and D'Aniello (2014) investigated the presence of post-deployment stressors for military service members and non-linked partners of service members (i.e. participants were not members of the same dyad). What these researchers found was that both the presence of mental health symptoms of the service member and the partner's perception of their mental health symptoms had an impact on a couple's ability to effectively navigate the post-deployment experience. Both partners and service member's perception of the others mental health has an impact on the couple's stress levels. The strategy to combat this stress would be open communication which is an activity often cited as difficult for re-integrating couples to achieve. 
Their are many tasks involved in reintegrating and dealing with the stressors of post-deployment life. A few key tasks are managing/redefining roles and expectations, and Division of Household Responsibilities; b) Creating Intimacy in Relationships; and c) Creating a Sense of Shared Meaning Surrounding the Deployment Experience (Bowling and Sherman, 2008). 
During deployment the spouse is the sole proprietor of the house and upon the return, the service member may feel like they no longer fit into the family routine. Navigating the redefining of roles can be a difficult feat to accomplish. Flexibility and communication are paramount to that success (Bowling and Sherman, 2008). 
Building those connections with your partner is key to reintegration success. Self disclosure is seen as one way for couples to come together and connect interpersonally. Self-disclosure can be hard for the service member because soldiers may feel they can only be understood by fellow soldiers (Cox, 2012). Additionally soldiers are seen as the “rock” of the family and are considered strong burden bearers and therefore may less open to vulnerable communication. This open communication is also important in creating the shared meaning of deployment mentioned above. Being able to foster family cohesion through shared meaning has the potential to aid the service member in feeling wanted as a part of the family and it can help the civilian partner feel like they gained something out of the deployment (Bowling and Sherman, 2008).
## Positive Outcomes of Deployment
Historically much of the literature is focused on the negative consequences of a military deployment. In the literature however, couples do cite positive outcomes of navigating a military deployment. A deployment can be a time to test the strength of the relationship by forcing meaningful and conversations and building deeper connections between the partners. In an investigation of utilizing CBT couple's therapy during reintegration, Sayers (2010) found that 9% of married service members reported an improvement of their relationship with their spouse as a result of deployment. Another study that followed a unit assigned to peacekeeping missions in Europe found 77% percent of soldiers reporting some kind of benefit as a result of deployment. The three most reported benefits were: making additional money, self-improvement, and "time to think" (Newby, 2005).
## State of The Literature
There is a general lack of evidence that wartime deployment has a universally negative impact on marital satisfaction and stability (Sayers, 2010). This is supported by research that focuses on the coping methods utilized by military spouses during the deployment phase of the deployment cycle. Larsen identified coping strategies utilized by Army wives that center around three general domains: individual coping, family beliefs, and sociocultural processes. 
## Current Contribution
The intention of this study is to build on the work that has already been done in the field of military couples research and to provide a unique approach to understanding the lives of military couples as they reintegrate their lives following a deployment. The stress of reintegration impacts family members and family units differently and thus it is necessary to investigate each of those components of the family structure separately (Marek, 2014). By attempting to understand the *lived experience* of the military couple *as a dyad* and through a qualitative lens, we are hoping to gain valuable information surrounding both the challenges of reintegrating together but also the positive protective factors that make reintegration easier and more meaningful. Better understanding of how a couple deals with and reacts to stressful events can provide insight into what is detrimental and what is strengthening for military couples. Repeated exposure to stress may be valuable learning experiences for couples that leads to maturation and learning (Palmer, 2008).
