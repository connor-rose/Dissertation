### Survey Questions and Format
This study is interested in understanding your experience as a member of a military couple.  Specifically we are interested in what is was like for you in the phase of the deployment known as post-deployment. This is the 6 month time period after you or your partner returned home from deployment. We will be asking questions about both your experience and your partners experience. Please try to answer questions about your partner to the best of your ability, with the understanding that you only have so much insight into their personal experience.
